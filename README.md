# HOW WILL IT WWORKS
Simple, you upload ONLY one file index.php and login as admin and you can edit files, create new files. Its base on responsive technologies. 
Editor wil be Codemirror for syntax. (But I dont know that is possible to add to one files...)

1. Secure login auth
2. TraNNslate to other language

# DO NOT UPLOAD THE FILE NOW. PLEASE EDIT THE ADMIN PASSWORD: THERE ARE DEFAULT PASSOWORD: ITS VERY DANGEROUS.
